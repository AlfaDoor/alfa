        <h4 class="oe_slogan">An import of goods is the entry of goods in the territory of the Implementing States from a place outside that territory, where the goods are cleared through customs (i.e., not placed under a customs duty suspension regime1 ). Until Bahrain recognizes one or more GCC Member States as Implementing States, all goods entering into Bahrain that are cleared through customs will be regarded as imports of goods for VAT purposes. The mere fact that goods enter Bahrain and are customs cleared is enough for an import of goods to have taken place for VAT purposes. Furthermore,
            an import of goods does not require an actual supply (e.g., sale) between two separate parties or for consideration to be paid.:</h4>

        <h2 class="oe_slogan" style="color:#875A7B;">Recovery of the VAT paid on import of goods:</h2>
        <h4 class="oe_slogan">A taxable person registered for VAT in Bahrain can claim the VAT paid on his imports of goods provided the conditions for input tax recovery as set out in the VAT Law and the Executive Regulations are all met (i.e., the taxable person will use the goods for the making of taxable supplies and the recovery of VAT on these goods is not disallowed). The use of an erroneous VAT number will preclude the taxable person from claiming import VAT back from the NBR.
It is essential that the taxable person keeps records of the customs documentation issued by Bahrain Customs Affairs which proves that he imported the goods into Bahrain and paid the VAT due on them (or deferred the payment to his tax return). These are the documents which will allow the taxable person to support the recovery of the VAT and claim this VAT back in his tax return.
In practice, import VAT can be recovered as input tax in the taxable persons tax return for the tax period during which all the conditions for input tax recovery are met. It is expected to be the tax return for the tax period during which the import of the goods took place and import VAT was paid to the Bahrain Customs Affairs.
Where the payment of import tax has been deferred to the taxable persons tax return, the taxable person will be able to also report this VAT as a recoverable input tax within the same tax return (provided all the conditions for recovery are met at that time, including the customs documentation supporting the deferral of payment).
